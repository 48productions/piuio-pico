# PIUIO-PICO

This is a WIP and *very* barebones codebase for what I hope will become a Raspberry Pi Pico-based PIUIO Clone.

**This codebase is currently partially functional!**

## Hardware Setup
 - Raspberry Pi Pico

## Firmware Setup

## Credits
This is heavily based off of the [tinyusb device USB examples](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/tree/master/examples/device) (specifically webusb_serial and hid_generic_input)

Protocol information from the [PIUIO_Arduino](https://github.com/ckdur/PIUIO_Arduino/) and [piuio_clone](https://github.com/racerxdl/piuio_clone/) repositories.
