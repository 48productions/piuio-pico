# PIUIO-PICO

This is a Pump it Up IO board (PIUIO) clone based on the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.

Though designed for [dj505's handpump controller](https://github.com/dj505/handpump), this will work with DIY hand pump controller builds, and can probably be adapted for pad use, too.

## Hardware Setup
You don't need many components to put one together:
 - Raspberry Pi Pico
 - 12x switches (for the 10 pad switches, plus test and service buttons)
 - 10x LEDs and appropriate resistors

<pinouts/schematics coming soon>

## Firmware Setup
[See the Pi Pico SDK repo](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) for instructions on preparing the build environment. All the required CMake files should already be present and ready for compilation.

General overview:
 - Add the SDK via your method of choice (see the pico-sdk repo)
 - Run `git submodule update --init` inside the SDK directory to set up the other required libraries (namely tinyusb)
 - Create the "build" folder inside the "piuio-pico" folder.
 - Inside the build folder, run `cmake ..`, then run `make`. You'll get a .UF2 file in the build folder that you can upload to the Pico!
 - With the Pico unplugged from the PC, hold the "BOOTSEL" button on the Pico, then plug in the Pico.
 - The Pico will now show up as a "flash drive" in your OS. Copy the .UF2 file onto the Pico, and the code will be uploaded!
